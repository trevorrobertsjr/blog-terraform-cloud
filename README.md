# BLOG-TERRAFORM-CLOUD

This Terraform module deploys an OS-only runtime Lambda to execute Go code to invalidate a CloudFront cache. It is applied to an AWS environment using dynamic credentials. Before using this repo, make sure you follow [HashiCorp documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces/dynamic-provider-credentials/aws-configuration) to properly configure an OIDC provider in AWS and your Terraform Cloud workspace accordingly.
